This React project helped me developed many new skills for a professional developer  such as "thinking in React" and "State management". I've checked: </br>
* Fundamentals of State Manegement;
* Thinking about State and "Lifting Up State";
* More Child-to-Parent Communication;
* Deleting, add, update Components: Complex Immutable Data Operation;
* Derived State;
* Sorting state (.localeCompare or boolean to Number compare) before rendering to UI; 

  This project was part of my Udemy "The ultimate React Course 2024" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
  Here are some peeks of my Far Away App:
